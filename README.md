# Group Projects Repository

Welcome to our Group Projects repository! This repo contains a collection of projects developed by our team using various technologies, including Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Streamlit, and a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core language for all projects
- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Models for classification, regression, etc.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: Neural networks using TensorFlow/Keras
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web apps
- **HTML/CSS/JS**: Web development basics for front-end

## Projects
1. **Python Basics**  
   A collection of Python scripts demonstrating basic programming concepts.

2. **Machine Learning Models**  
   - Classification, regression, and clustering models implemented using popular algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KMeans).
   - Examples include predicting housing prices, customer segmentation, and more.

3. **Deep Learning Projects**  
   - **Image Classification**: CNN models for classifying images from datasets like MNIST and CIFAR-10.
   - **NLP**: RNN/LSTM models for text processing and sentiment analysis.

4. **Streamlit Web Apps**  
   - Interactive web apps built with Streamlit for displaying ML results, visualizations, and models.

5. **HTML, CSS, JS Projects**  
   - Basic web development projects that involve creating static websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
